# Hi there, I'm Yash Shende 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate **DevOps Engineer** and a recent MBA graduate in **Business Analytics**. With 2+ years of experience in the DevOps field, I specialize in automating workflows, managing cloud infrastructure, and optimizing development pipelines.

## 🚀 Key Projects
### 📊 **CRM Application - DevOps Project**
A collaborative project where we built and managed a **CRM application**. The infrastructure combined on-premise resources with **AWS**, utilizing **Angular**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**. We focused on optimizing the entire software lifecycle with CI/CD pipelines and automation tools like **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Terraform**.

### ⚙️ **CI/CD & Infrastructure Automation**
- **Jenkins** for automating the build and deployment pipelines.
- **Terraform** to provision and manage AWS resources like EC2, S3, VPC, and IAM roles.
- **Docker** for creating and managing containerized application images.
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring performance metrics across environments.
